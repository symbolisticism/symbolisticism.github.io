        <p style="color:black;">Dogweed and Deathcap is your one stop for everything you need for potions, brews, and more. Not only that, but you can also buy all sorts of exotic plants and flowers for family, friends, a classmate, or your own personal interests. </p>

        <p style="color:black;">Gringotts is known worldwide for being the securest bank. It is run by goblins who traverse an extensive and very complicated set of underground tunnels and railway systmes. Beyond that, some of the vaults are even guarded by dragons! Some say that Nicolas Flamel's Sorceror's Stone was once buried deep inside Gringotts!</p>

        <p style="color:black;">Hogsmeade Station is the main entrance for travellers coming into Hogsmeade. Many students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry come to Hogsmeade for the weekend twice in the school year, once in winter and once in spring, and they leave school on this train coming through this station. Known for its iconic scarlet steam train, this is one place you'll want to stop and take photos.</p>

        <p style="color:black;">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is the largest school for young witches and wizards in Great Britain. It was founded over 1,500 years ago. Every year, a new wave of 11-year-olds gets sorted into one of the four Hogwarts houses: Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin.</p>

        <p style="color:black;">If you've got a sweet tooth, Honeyduke's is the only place that can fill your craving. With the largest selection of various candies and confections, you are sure to find something you like there. Some crowd pleasers are Chocolate Frogs, Fizzing Whizbees, Bertie's Every Flavored Beans, and Pumpkin Pasties.</p>

        <p style="color:black;">The Leaky Cauldron is a consistent pub. Consistently shady, consistently a little dark inside, and consistently a place where you hold onto your money. Despite its not-so-kid-friendly ambience, The Leaky Cauldron is a good stop for a drink, and it serves as an entrance to Diagon Alley from the Muggle World.</p>

        <p style="color:black;">When walking by this shop, you'll mostly see younger wizards getting their first wands. Ollivanders has been in the wand business since before most of us were born. Mr. Ollivander shows his prowess over wand lore every time you see him at work. If you have not yet gotten your first wand, or yours needs repair, make sure to stop in and see Mr. Ollivander!</p>

        <p style="color:black;">Warm butter beer is what draws most people to The Three Broomsticks. Madam Rosmerta provides a very welcoming environment at her inn and pub. Almost as good as the food and drink there, you are bound to see some of the Hogwarts staff eating and discussing all kinds of gossip, which can be easily overheard with a little help from an invisibility cloak.</p>

        <p style="color:black;">With the speediest mail service in northern England, the Owl Post is a great place to stop if you want to send postcards by owl to your friends and family of the fun time you are having in Hogsmeade. We hope you enjoy your time here!</p>
