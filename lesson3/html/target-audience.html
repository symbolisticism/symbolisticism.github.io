          <p>
            Our first persona is Barba Whipthrash, who is a bookstore owner in
            Hogsmeade. She has a husband and two kids at home. She is active in
            her kid's school parent organization and in the organization
            S.P.E.W. She thinks the upcoming generation is veering away from
            books, and she wants to help them see the magic in reading again.
            She joined the HCOC in order to help her business thrive and to
            encourage people to dive deeper into ancient literature and complex
            spellbooks.

            Our second persona is Maximo Strale, a community member who
            practices the art of meditation for the purpose of increasing spell
            potency. He is not married because he has devoted his life to the
            study of meditation. Connecting to the people around him is one of
            his priorities, so he decided to join the HCOC in order to feel a
            greater connection to his community. He wants to find more friends
            and mentors to learn from, and he wants to contribute to other
            people's learning and development.

          <p>
            People in the Hogsmeade area will visit the website to see what
            events are going on in town. Families with young kids know what it's
            like to need to get out of the house for a while. The website will
            have a discover page that will always display the latest news on
            events and activities in town.
          </p>

        <div class="scenarios">
          <h3>Tour Your Town</h3>
          <p>
            People who have recently moved in and people who've been here a long
            time will both have an interest in getting to know our town better.
            On the home page, there will be weather updates, important news,
            business spotlights, and more. People looking to know Hogsmeade
            better will come to the page to find new things they want to try, or

            with the day-to-day in Hogsmeade.

          <h3>Join the Board of Directors</h3>
          <p>
            Business owners who want to encourage the local economy and
            community members who want to contribute to the overall wellness of
            the town will visit the website to to find out how they can join the
            board of directors. Getting involved is the best way to make a
            difference, so we are going to include a section on the website for
            a form where people can express interest in joining and also send in
            an application. The more people who join, the better.

          <h3>Get Contact information</h3>
          <p>
            This website will contain a working directory - a living document
            keeping track of all the businesses in Hogsmeade. People will visit
            this website to find contact information for different businesses to
            get business hours, prices, phone numbers, and other information.
            Having the contact information for businesses in one central
            location will help many business gain traction. For example, traffic
            in different parts of the city is probably varied, but in the
            directory, all the businesses have equal real estate. This will
            connect people with businesses, and it will help to spread the
            wealth around the town.
