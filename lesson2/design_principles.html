          <p>
            The Honeywell mobile web page is a good example of white space and
            clean design. You can see that the pictures and text have enough
            negative space for each element to exist in its own space. The web
            page has good, clean alignment throughout, which contributes to a
            harmonious layout that is attractive to the eye. The pictures are of
            professional quality.

          <p>
            Nike's mobile web page is a good example of Fitt's Law. You could
            reasonably say that Nike's main objective is to get you to buy a
            pair of their shoes. Nike has made it extremely convenient and quick
            to get to the shopping page and the shopping cart. Any customer on
            the home page is one button push away from the shopping cart and two
            button pushes from the shopping pages.

          />
          <p>
            Disney's mobile web page uses repetition to drive the user towards a
            Disney+ subscription. If you scroll down the page, you see that
            there's a lot of content that points towards things that are only
            available on Disney+. By repetitively mentioning their subscription
            service and showing what is exclusively available to subscribers,
            they are able to better convince people to subscribe.
